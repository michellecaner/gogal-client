        <h3>Welcome to Go Gal, {yourName}!</h3>
        <p>Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red.</p>
